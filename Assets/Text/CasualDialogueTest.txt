[NAME=Inés]

It's taken me ages to get mon château just right.

I simply cannot bear this door anymore.

Begone door!

Get it out!

Move!

Allons-y, allons-y!

My children won't speak to me.

Strong human — you can do it!

My vases, pillars, chandeliers... my joys.

Come on, I could go faster than that.

Bless you, mon petit homme.

Go on, get it out!

Go faster!

Rapide! Rapide!

AHHHHHHHHH!

Why do you smell like bugs?

Live and learn!
